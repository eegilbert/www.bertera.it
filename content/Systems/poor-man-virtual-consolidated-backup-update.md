I just received a little patch to my
[pmvcb](http://www.bertera.it/index.php/2011/07/25/poor-man-vmware-consolidate-backup/ "pmvcb")
from Tilman Schmidt.  
This patch add the support for the new ESXi syntax of
**snapshot.remove**.

You can download the last pmvcb from my Github
[page](https://github.com/pbertera/pmvcb "pmvcb download from github")

Thanks Tilman.
